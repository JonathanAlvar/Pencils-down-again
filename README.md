Project description:

Creat a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so user can gauge progress compared to other

My code:

I ran into extreme difficulty when attempting to have the questions and options pushed to the HTML as well as storing the initials. The last question in my array wil populate in the console log but I am not able to get the questions and possible answers to render. Timer starts on click and runs down to zero but I am having a lot of trouble with the rendering of the questions function. I was trying to render the questions through a for loop and grabing each question indiviudally.
